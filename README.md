# Project 2 - Photo Grid

## Project Summary
A one page responsive website was created building on past lessons in HTML/CSS and incorporating Ajax, JSON, and API concepts. The site dynamically populates a grid of images based on a hashtag search through Instagram's API. Additional functionality includes a 'load more' button that adds 12 more images.

## Tools Used
- HTML/CSS
- CSS animation
- JQuery
- Ajax
- Gulp, SASS, BrowserSync, Autoprefixer
- Git and GitHub
- Cygwin terminal/Scotchbox/Vagrant

## Experiences
Gulp and automation tasks was a great addition to our tool kit. It's fantastic to see live updates to the site as it was being built instead of manually refreshing the page with each change. Automation of tasks such as minification and adding browser prefixes is also a great time saver.

Learning about API's was exciting and challenging. It took a little bit of time, but I was able to fully wrap my head around how to navigate the JSON object to pull out the properties for this project. It's opening some great new possibilities for future projects and working with other APIs.

Git and GitHub for version control and project backup is a great and invaluable tool as it integrates better with a development environment than OneDrive.
